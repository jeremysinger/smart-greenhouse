# Smart Greenhouse Project

A smart greenhouse includes electronic sensors with data storage and 
online reporting. At the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk) we have
been creating lightweight, low-cost smart greenhouse sensors with
[Raspberry Pi](https://raspberrypi.org) nodes.

This repository includes code for deploying a Raspberry Pi with attached
sensors, also instructions for attaching sensors to a Pi and configuring them.

# On-site Deployments

We currently support a smart greenhouse at the Lion's Gate, Edinburgh Napier
University, and a smart greenhouse testbed in partnership with 
[Networks for Learning](http://n4luk.org/).
